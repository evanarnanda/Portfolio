# Welcome to my portfolio
This page is contains few example data science project. Types of my project are such classification or class probability estimation, regression, similarity, clustering and there are some project using deep learning. Most my projects are from Datacamp, and I got instruction from my instructures to do the project.


# 1. [Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sTwnWgV16d2n7evqSWbbB8OpOIaTDITi?usp=sharing)
This project use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:

* loading and viewing the dataset
* see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries
* preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions
* EDA or exploratory data analysis to create senses of the data
* Finally, building a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

# 2. [Comparing Cosmetics by Ingredients](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pMSgkDcj9fwA9kqePErURzWP7VBwMUoz?usp=sharing)
This project is to helping people that strugle to predict cosmetic product that good for them. This project also example for content-based recommendation system. The structure of this notebook is as follows:

* loading and viewing the dataset
* filtering the data to one category product and one skin type
* pre-processing the data
* exploring high-dimentional data with t-SNE
* visualizing the data with Bokeh.

# 3. [Predict Blood Donations](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18hqxoKP5rqo4Z2yxi6_C54NsapwaHvHJ?usp=sharing)
I do this project to practicing my knowlege about machine learning. Building a supervised machine learning model may help me to get more knowledge about ML. Goal from this project is to predict who will likely to donate blood again. Apperently this is an example of real world problem because forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers: in January 2019.
